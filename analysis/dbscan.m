% DBSCAN DBSCAN clustering algorithm
%
% Usage:  [C, ptsC, centres] = dbscan(P, E, min_pts)
%
% INPUT ARGUMENTS:
%         P - dim x Npts array of points.
%         E - Distance threshold. Must be a positive number.
%         min_pts - Minimum number of points required to form a cluster.
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
%         C   -- Cell array of length Nc listing indices of points associated with
%                each cluster.
%      labels -- Array of length Npts listing the cluster label associated with
%                each point.  If a point is denoted as noise (not enough nearby
%                elements to form a cluster) its cluster number is 0.
%       centres -- dim x Nc array of the average centre of each cluster.
% REQUIRES: 
%          -  utilis/dis()
